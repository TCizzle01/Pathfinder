This project is designed to be a meet up page for new paretnts to meet at parks, trails, etc. It displays the weather for any city, and has a form to join the group. 

This page features countdown clock, contact form including regex, and weather API.  In future updates, I would like to have to countdown clock count to a specific date instead of just being a timer.  

The page will check the form for a valid email address. If one is not detected, an error message will appear upon submission. 

Typing a city name in the Weather feature and clicking submit will display the current weather for that city.
